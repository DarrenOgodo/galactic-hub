Scientists believe Mercury's core makes up about 85% of its volume, a much larger proportion than other terrestrial planets.",

Interestingly, a day-night cycle on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 176 Earth days due to its 3:2 resonance between rotation and orbit. This makes it one of the most unique rotational systems in our Solar System."
